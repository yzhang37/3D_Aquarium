##### Construct your two different creatures
# Requirements:
#   1. For the basic parts of your creatures, feel free to use routines provided with the previous assignment.
#   You are also free to create your own basic parts, but they must be polyhedral (solid).
#   2. The creatures you design should have moving linkages of the basic parts: legs, arms, wings, antennae,
#   fins, tentacles, etc.
#   3. Model requirements:
#         1. Predator: At least one (1) creature. Should have at least two moving parts in addition to the main body
#         2. Prey: At least two (2) creatures. The two prey can be instances of the same design. Should have at
#         least one moving part.
#         3. The predator and prey should have distinguishable different colors.
#         4. You are welcome to reuse your PA2 creature in this assignment.

        ##### BONUS 6: Group behaviors

        #   for instance flocking together. This can be achieved by implementing the
        #   [Boids animation algorithms](http://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/) of Craig Reynolds.

        ##### TODO 3: Interact with the environment
        # Requirements:
        #   1. Your creatures should always stay within the fixed size 3D "tank". You should do collision detection
        #   between it and tank walls. When it hits with tank walls, it should turn and change direction to stay
        #   within the tank.
        #   2. Your creatures should have a prey/predator relationship. For example, you could have a bug being chased
        #   by a spider, or a fish eluding a shark. This means your creature should react to other creatures in the tank
        #       1. Use potential functions to change its direction based on other creaturesâ€™ location, their
        #       inter-creature distances, and their current configuration.
        #       2. You should detect collisions between creatures.
        #           1. Predator-prey collision: The prey should disappear (get eaten) from the tank.
        #           2. Collision between the same species: They should bounce apart from each other. You can use a
        #           reflection vector about a plane to decide the after-collision direction.
        #       3. You are welcome to use bounding spheres for collision detection.
