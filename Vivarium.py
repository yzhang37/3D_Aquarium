    #   Add chunks of food to the vivarium which can be eaten by your creatures.
    #     * When ‘f’ is pressed, have a food particle be generated at random within the vivarium.
    #     * Be sure to draw the food on the screen with an additional model. It should drop slowly to the bottom of
    #     the vivarium and remain there within the tank until eaten.
    #     * The food should disappear once it has been eaten. Food is eaten by the first creature that touches it.
